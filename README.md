# Harold Hotter's House Hassels
Harrold Hotter's House Hassels (Alitteration is fun!) is our take on the concept of the Pottermore website.  

In this game you can:  
Create a character  
Choose a house, wand, familiar  
Learn and forget Spells  

Learning spells gains your house points, unless it's... forbidden.  
You can view the information for your house and all the houses.  
Stats page has analytics on most common familar, wands, spell, etc.
